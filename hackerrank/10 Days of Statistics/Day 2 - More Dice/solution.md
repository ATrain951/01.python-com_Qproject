#### Task

In a single toss of **2** fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of **6**.

___

#### Answer: _1/9_

---

There will be only 4 possible results:

* (1, 5)
* (5, 1)
* (2, 4)
* (4, 2)

Total results will be: 6 * 6 = 36

Therefore probability will be **4/36 = 1/9**
