#### Task

You draw **2** cards from a standard **52**-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

___

#### Answer: _12/51_

---

> (1) Initially you have 52 cards, 13 * 4 (4 suites). There are 13 ways to select a color card out of 52.
>
> (2) Then again if you pick one more card, there are 12 remaining of the same color, out of total 51 remaining cards.
>
> No. of ways to select 2 cards = (1) * (2) = 13/52 * 12/51 = 3/51.
>
> This is for 1 color, as there are 4 colors, total = 4 * 3/51 = **12/51**.
